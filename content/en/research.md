My thesis goal is to extract patterns and knowledge from sensor data in order to drive improvements in the way customers use a given product. In this context, the fields of interest are:
* Time Series Analysis, [code](https://github.com/octavian-h/time-series-math)
* Recommendation Systems
* Sentiment Analysis

I am part of the [Knowledge Engineering Research Group](http://keg.utcluj.ro/). My current focus is on overcoming source signal dependence in time series analysis.
